# Anamolous_Behaviour_Detection_In_LiveCamera
This is a Deep Learning which Detects Anamolous Behaviour in Live Camera,It can be used for providing Security in Organisations like schools,colleges,Hospitals etc

This project does not use any available datasets,for training the model we need to give normal and abnormal poses which will be collected by using posecol.py for training the model

posetrain.py is used to train the model for detecting normal and abnormal behaviour in a live camera

posetest.py performs testing of model and detects  normal and abnormal behaviour in a live camera

libraries used:opencv,tensorflow,keras etc

Technlogy used:LSTM (Deep Learning)

IDLE: Spyder

Virtual Environment:anaconda 

it is recommended to use Anaconda Virtual Environment
